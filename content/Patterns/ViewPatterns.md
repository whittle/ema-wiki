# ViewPatterns

The ViewPatterns extension adds a new syntax to existing patterns. Instead of
writing a pattern that the argument will be matched against, you write two
things in the form `(e -> p)`. Here `e` is an arbitrary expression and `p` is a
pattern. Where without a view pattern the corresponding argument would be
matched against a pattern directly, instead the expression will be evaluated
with the patternâ€™s argument as its arguemnt, and its result will then be matched
against the given pattern.

One interesting use is to replace [NPlusKPatterns](NPlusKPatterns) by using the `subtract`
function as a view.
